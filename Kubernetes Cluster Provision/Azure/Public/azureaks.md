## ğŸš€ Steps to Deploy

1. **Navigate to the Terraform project directory**:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/terraform/project
```

2. **Initialize Terraform**:

```bash
terraform init
```

3. **Validate Terraform code**:

```bash
terraform validate
```

4. **Review the Terraform execution plan**:

```bash
terraform plan
```

5. **Apply Terraform to create the infrastructure**:

```bash
terraform apply
```

You will be prompted to confirm with `yes`.

6. **Optional: Save apply output to a log file**:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve > apply-log.txt
```
